githaven (0.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * When forking a private repository give the forked owner read-only permissions to the repository
  * Add a tooltip to the public/private icon. - When the repository is private set the tooltip to explictly state that   Everyone can not access the repository. - When the repository is public set the tooltip to be the permissions   that Everyone has. - Add a tooltip to the private icon in the repository listing - Move the gravatar function to the user model rather then in the helper and add a helper function to the user class.
  * git update-server-info needs to be run whenever something changes for http to work, not just after git init. Add update-server-info to the httpgit action.
  * git fetching over http could access the wrong repository. Access the repository using the user+repo combination not just the repository name otherwise it will simply go to the first one the was created with the repository name which might not be the one that is wanted.
  * When a repository is deleted rm -rf the location of the repository.
  * When deleting a user mention that the repositories will be deleted too

githaven (0.0.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add the ability for a user to click on a link and fork a repository. - The name and description are copied - Tags are copied - If the original repository doesn't allow Everyone it is also removed   in the fork.
  * Because flash content is run though the h helper function we can't use links.
  * Be a little safer and check that repository.description is not nil before using it.
  * Set the white-space on the commit to pre-wrap so it wont look so ugly
  * When showing a commit and its diff display the full commit message.
  * Remove test script that was accidentally added.
  * Add a HACKING file to the repository giving some basic information about the project and directories.
  * Execute git shell, not git-shell when someone uses the ssh handler.
  * Use the full 80% width to display the repository list, not 80% of 80%
  * Show the owner of the repository and populate the title (image tooltip) with the user name and permissions.  For example "icefox rw".
  * Improve githaven-* bash scripts to be safer when dealing with variables, use {} and "" to be more specific and less likely to result in any accidental issues.
  * When determining the id of the repository name both the name of the repository and the id of the ownser is needed because multiple users can have repositories with the same name.
  * When creating a repository update the server info so cloning over http will work
  * Fix several errors found with the W3C Markup Validator
  * Fix several errors found with the W3C CSS Validator
